# About
An application where records with the attendance of students for laboratory exercises are stored and managed.
Management means:
- record creation
- registration of students with the help of unique bar codes
- archiving of older records
- print records and exports them to Excel
- printing of unique laboratory documents for testing students
- issuance and submission of laboratory documents by students
- archiving of laboratory documents

Access to the application is implemented based on the user or username (can be created using a barcode). The application allows you to access only some or all functions and the administrative part (based on the logged-in user).

The application was created in the development environment MS Visual Studio 2017 and is localized into the Slovak language together with a brief help implemented as dialog.

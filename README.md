# About
An application in which records with the attendance of students for laboratory exercises are stored and managed.

Management means:
- record creation
- registration of students with the help of unique bar codes
- archiving of older records
- print records and export them to Excel
- printing of unique laboratory documents for testing students
- records of issuance and submission of laboratory documents by students
- archiving of laboratory documents

Access to the application is implemented on the basis of the user or username (can be created using a barcode).
Based on the logged in user, the application allows you to access only some or all functions and the administrative part.

The application was created in the development environment MS Visual Studio 2017 and was completely localized into the Slovak language together with a brief help implemented as dialog.
